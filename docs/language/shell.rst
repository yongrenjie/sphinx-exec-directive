Shell
=====

All shell scripts are run with ``sh``.

Note that in general, ``sh`` will not necessarily have the same behaviour as the shell which you use in your terminal (e.g. ``bash`` or ``zsh``): see ``man sh``, or `this Stack Overflow link <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5725296>`_ for more details.
In particular, configuration files are not sourced.

However, you *will* have access to environment variables, notably including ``$PATH``.
This is because the subprocess which runs the code inherits environment variables from the calling process (i.e. Sphinx).
