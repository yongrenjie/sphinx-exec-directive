API reference
=============

Technically, you can ``import sphinx_exec_directive`` in a script and use the functions within just like any other Python package (if for some reason that is useful).
However, **this interface is unstable**: the public interface of this package is defined by its usage in Sphinx documents, not by the functions it provides.


.. automodule:: sphinx_exec_directive.run
